### Preword

Yes, I love taking notes with Surface Pro 3. However, I feel I don't really use it much and it is too heavy to carry around. So I have been trying to find a replacement. After doing some research on Amazon, I decide to abuse my prime membership a bit. I ordered bamboo spark (easy return on Amazon is so nice!!! Free 30-day trial on almost everything).

### OpenBox

Here is the box:

Bamboo Spark is pretty well made. Quite classy actually. But Let's get to the real stuff: the performance.

### What you might really Care:

I have wrote something on one page:

What it looks like in its digital format:

#### Pros:

* The performance is ok, it picks up almost everything.
* It is much easier to write with an actual ball pen than a stylus.
* The feel is pretty nice.

#### Cons:

* The resolution is way worse than notes written on surface pro.
* Only supports A5 size.
* Pen refill is like 1/3 the size of a normal ball pen. So the ink runs out quick. The refills are pretty expensive; priced at $9.99 for 3 refills. 
* No App on Mac. Because I mainly use it to draw graphs to put into my CS notes. It's actually pretty annoying as I have to go to the website and export it as an image and insert it into my notes.

### Sum it up

Really nice looking piece of digital notepad at the cost of $149.95 on Amazon currently. It is quite pricy for its limited functionality. I think I will keep using it for a while. However, the limited size, poor resolution and lack of desktop app are quite troublesome. I think I would return it and wait for some future improvements. If it implements vector image instead of these lousy pixels and develops a desktop app with a cost under 100 bucks, it would be a must-by for me.



### Help

Any suggestion of a different product to draw graphs to use in my notes?
