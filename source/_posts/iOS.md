### Preword:

A friend of a friend asked me if I could join their team to work on a project and build iOS app for him.  Considering iOS is pretty popular and it is never bad to learn some new stuffs, I did some research and got a list of tutorials. Realizing their volumes and my productivity during vacations, I don't know if I could learn it all during the summer.
