## Projects I have worked on

- [DOTA IMBA](https://www.dota2imba.org/)
  A Custom game for Valve's popular *DOTA2*. Has 6 million subscribers now.

- [MoegirlPedia](https://zh.moegirl.org/Mainpage) ([Portal to English Site](https://en.moegirl.org/Mainpage))
  A public wiki for comic and anime fans.

## Projects I am actively working on

- [E-discovery](https://github.com/xxf1995/comps_ediscovery)
  Electronic discovery implemented in python. 

  - Includes `Random forest` algorithm built from scratch with `Python3`.
  - Includes `parallelization ` on multi-core systems using `Multiprocessing` module from `Python3`.
  - Includes` incremental learning system` for `semi-supervised learning`.
  - Includes data cleaning and other data manipulation techniques to convert documents to `LSA matrix` of topics.
  - Includes a full-powered `VueJS` frontend web app.

- [Mahu(码乎)](http://mahu-search.herokuapp.com/)
  - A portal/gateway for Chinese developers who do not have access to the awesome world of `GSOP(Google-and-Stackoverflow-Oriented-Programming)`.
  - Taker user query and search for Q&As on `stackoverflow`.
  - Format and transalte answers.
  - **Issue:** 
    - As the communist party is getting more and more control over the Internet public space. Hard to find a reliable and free translation api.
    - No idea how to reach to our potential users yet.

- [Darwin Island](https://github.com/xxf1995/darwin-island-game)
  - This game intends to build a multiplayer experience like [agar.io](http://agar.io/).
  - But with entirely different flavor.
  - Players get to design their creature in dozens of aspects.
  - Players can play as their creation.
  - Or they can write a AI(Algorithmic behavior pattern) for their creature.
    - Maybe some day we can take this game on blockchain so players can trade their algorithms. (Potentially with `Darwin Coin`)
    - Yeah, maybe one day.
  - Compete in Randonly generated maps(under certain limits) and be the one and only survivor!
